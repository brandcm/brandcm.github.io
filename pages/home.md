I'm a postdoctoral scholar in the [Capra Lab](https://capralab.github.io/) at University of California San Francisco and am affiliated with the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute and the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. In my current research, I use computational and machine learning approaches to better understand the evolutionary biology of humans and our closest relatives from genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic data.

My research philosophy is grounded in collaboration, equity, and transparency. I'm privileged to work with many talented colleagues on different projects in my research program and am always open to new collaborators. As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I appreciate the need for diversity in science and work to increase equity for my own community and other historically marginalized groups. I am committed to open and reproducible science, which not only underlies scientific rigor but is also fundamental to equity in science.

A more detailed description of my research program can be found on the Research page and a list of publications with access to the articles, code, and data can be found on the Publications page. My current CV is linked below. Please do not hesitate to get in touch via email, colin.brand@ucsf.edu, or using the links in the footer.
